# CPPND: Capstone Snake Game Example

This is a starter repo for the Capstone project in the [Udacity C++ Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/c-plus-plus-nanodegree--nd213). The code for this repo was inspired by [this](https://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/212296/snake-game-in-c-with-sdl) excellent StackOverflow post and set of responses.

This project is a classic snake game with some features. It has superfood which will appear after eating 10 basic food. Superfood costs 5 scores and will appear only for 10 sec. Try to avoid the walls and tail of the snake.

In this diagram, you can see how classes work with each other.
The class Common has common attributes for the game like score, the number of food was eaten and terminated bool variable.
The class Controller takes inputs from the keyboard and makes changes in the Snake class.
The class Map makes a map for the game.
The class Snake moves the snake and grows its body.
The class Text helps the Render class to render text.
The class Renderer renders the map, snake and text for each frame.
The class Game runs the loop in which updates each frame and draws it with Render class.

The initial project already had Game, Controller, Renderer and Snake classes and the latest version of this code has additional classes Common, Text and Map. (Loops, Function, I/O and OOP)
